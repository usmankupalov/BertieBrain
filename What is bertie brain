# BertieBrain

##Bertie the Brain was an early computer game, and one of the first games developed in the early history of video games
##Bertie the Brain was a game of tic-tac-toe in which the player would select the position for their next move from a grid of nine lit buttons on a raised panel.
##The moves would appear on a grid of nine large squares set vertically on the machine as well as on the buttons, 
##with either an X- or O-shaped light turning on in the corresponding space. The computer would make its move shortly after. 
##A pair of signs to the right of the playfield, alternately lit up with "Electronic Brain" and an X or "Human Brain" and an O, 
##marked which player's turn it was, and would light up along with "Win" when a player had won. 
##Bertie could be set to several difficulty levels. 
##The computer responded almost instantly to the player's moves and at the highest difficulty level was designed to be unbeatable
